{"input": "the unit cost $ 275 to start with , so it is not worth repairing ."}
{"input": "going from acer 15 to acer 11 was difficult , 11 inches seems too small for me ."}
{"input": "also it ' s not a true ssd drive in there but emmc , which makes a difference ."}
{"input": "the computer has difficulty switching between tablet and computer ."}
{"input": "2 / 28 / 18 - a couple days ago i updated the chrome os ."}
{"input": "it ' s just that chrome doesn ' t work the same with a chromebook as it does with windows ."}
{"input": "hopefully in 10 years they ' ll have this figured out and it won ' t suck so badly ."}
{"input": "bought this last year on july ."}
{"input": "i rarely use the keyboard ."}
{"input": "- great price for a touchscreen chromebook"}
{"input": "it is glitchy , and barely usable ."}
{"input": "i ordered one , the touch pad failed to work consistently ."}
{"input": "i often find i ' ve typed an entire sentence ( or more ) with my fingers on the wrong keys , which is very unproductive when trying to take real - time notes in a meeting !"}
{"input": "i know it only takes a few seconds , but a new device should not be doing this and makes me question if it ' ll get worse in the future ."}
{"input": "i also have to press the trackpad very hard for left click ( not as badly as the first unit , though ) , and i lost right click functionality on the track pad 2 days into my voyage with this thing ."}
{"input": "i tried factory resetting after i updated the os , and it still drained 9 % over 8 hours ."}
{"input": "hdmi out doesn ' t work right ."}
{"input": "they had it over a week and then shipped back ."}
{"input": "i was excited to receive this chromebook , only to watch that excitement dissipate within mere hours as i noticed the touchscreen did n ' t work at all on tablet mode ."}
{"input": "clearly there is some kind of major defect here that acer has n ' t resolved ."}
{"input": "i bought this for my daughter to use to take online classes while she ' s overseas in europe for a year ."}
{"input": "decent sound quality ."}
{"input": "flimsy power adapter ."}
{"input": "wi - fi slows down to crowl and speeds back up intermittently ."}
{"input": "regret buying it at times ."}
{"input": "it just turned off and will not turn back on ."}
{"input": "the product is great , but the customer support is horrible ."}
{"input": "called support a second time after 10 minutes of verifying some type of info they told me to call google without even trying to help ."}
{"input": "but i ' m getting into photography now , and it ' s terrible for loading , storing , and editing pictures ."}
{"input": "i have sent it in twice already and waiting for it to come back ."}
{"input": "the screen looked great ."}
{"input": "no matter how many times i reinserted the charging adapter , i kept getting this message ."}
{"input": "i had no option but to shut down the computer , unplug it , plug it back in , and then reboot ."}
{"input": "it has worked well except for an initial hiccup on turning it on ."}
{"input": "the screen flashes for a second every 30 seconds or so ."}
{"input": "i noticed the battery went down to 67 % for no reason ."}
{"input": "works good but the fan kicks in pretty often , which is to keep the laptop cool but the sound is annoying ."}
{"input": "nano edge display is nice ."}
{"input": "everything was fine and i went out for an hour ."}
{"input": "the audio is almost impossible to hear ."}
{"input": "it is slow to do everything ."}
{"input": "here ' s the kicker : it is doing a terrible job running dragon age ."}
{"input": "it doesn ' t has backlit keyboard : ( typing in low light is such a pain ."}
{"input": "very disappointed in how slow it seems ."}
{"input": "keyboard and mouse pad seem fine , but overall it seems strangely slow ."}
{"input": "i have been using this for just 3 months ."}
{"input": "crazy keypad : this issue is even worse ."}
{"input": "overall , the laptop has a solid feel to it ."}
{"input": "this lead me to believe that although i purchased a \u201c new \u201d product , they sent me a refurbished one instead ."}
{"input": "i ' m out from us , i live in colombia , and maybe i can not return these laptop ."}
{"input": "i like the speed , the processor the hybrid storage units ( 128ssd and 1tera ) , but the web cam sucks , really poor resolution and the keyboard doesn ' t have the numerical part and the caps lock or num lock don ' t have any light or guide to help you ."}
{"input": "lightweight ."}
{"input": "yesterday the backlight went out ."}
{"input": "it was brand new out of the box , i ' ve never dropped it ."}
{"input": "now i have to deal with warranty stuff and sending it back etc ."}
{"input": "ram upgrade available"}
{"input": "hard drive upgrade available"}
{"input": "i had issues with the touchpad sticking or not responding to click correctly from the start ."}
{"input": "it ' s still a mainly functional computer , but using it is just not the greatest ."}
{"input": "we ' ve had the computer for 5 weeks , used it a total of less than 20 hours , and now it will be gone for 3 weeks ."}
{"input": "i send it to asus warranty and now after a week they ' re sending it back stating the no problem was found ."}
{"input": "display stop working within 2 months ."}
{"input": "since it came with no user manual , i had to call asus customer support and got someone who knew all about windows 10 software but nothing about my asus notebook ."}
{"input": "after reading all the bad reviews , just sent it back for a refund ."}
{"input": "all over this asus laptop which has a non - functioning touchpad ."}
{"input": "my screen broke when just putting a textbook on it ."}
{"input": "don ' t even bother calling customer support , in my experience , they do you no good ."}
{"input": "keyboard needs to be redesigned entirely ."}
{"input": "6 ` ` screen is big enough to read with ease , yet the item itself is light enough to tote to meetings ."}
{"input": "so far , this looks as if it meets my needs as a good ` ` work machine . ` `"}
{"input": "after exactly one year of useage this computer completely stopped working ."}
{"input": "it boots up in 10 seconds and shuts down in 2 to 3 seconds ."}
{"input": "i like the idea that the keyboard lights up and has a ` ` time out ` ` feature to shut off ."}
{"input": "it seems put together well ."}
{"input": "what they lack in size , they make up for in raw speed , durability , and energy efficiency ."}
{"input": "+ decent quantity of available ports"}
{"input": "+ it has a dvd drive : o"}
{"input": "- it runs hot !"}
{"input": "running grid benchmark , it got to a high 92 / 93 degrees c !"}
{"input": "- new i5 mobile processor ."}
{"input": "- ddr4 ram that is upgradable ."}
{"input": "- very decent battery life ."}
{"input": "so far i am pleasantly impressed with this unit , however i have not used it a long time or tested many applications to date ."}
{"input": "i can certainly say this is the best laptop i ' ve ever had ( but then again i ' ve only had 3 , and you would expect these things to improve over time , right ) ."}
{"input": "i ' ve been using it for at least 4 hours since last charged in that 23 % used up ."}
{"input": "- as others have mentioned , the keyboard backlight turns off after just a few seconds of not typing , which can be annoying and there doesn ' t seem to be a way to change this ."}
{"input": "- easily upgradeable ram"}
{"input": "one feature that i love is the ability to disable the touchpad from the keyboard ."}
{"input": "it ' s not fancy , but it ' s good value and fast and trouble - free ."}
{"input": "after spending some time with it , the feature can really be useful ."}
{"input": "easily upgrade to storage and ram ."}
{"input": "this does not really matter to me because the mx150 is enough for my needs ."}
{"input": "i love the solid state drive , as reviews or ads say you can boot up and get onto internet in 10 to 15 seconds ."}
{"input": "it ' s not a ` ` gaming ` ` laptop even it can do some more casual gaming ."}
{"input": "it ' s super fast , boots up in seconds ."}
{"input": "i am very impressed with this system ."}
{"input": "mastercam itself runs pretty good ."}
{"input": "as usual amazon was great about returning it ."}
{"input": "screen is decent , not great , it is matte finished ."}
{"input": "i like the back lit keyboard ."}
{"input": "it ' s a lot of good for a comparatively cheap price ."}
{"input": "the screen is perfectly adequate ."}
{"input": "this thing boots up super quick and it sleek and beautiful ."}
{"input": "google and partners have done great with chromebooks and have plenty of features to accommodate ."}
{"input": "i would highly recommend this to anyone , but especially to someone wanting something that is affordable , easy to use and just a bit more than a tablet ."}
{"input": "i ' m getting very used to the multiple finger shortcuts on the touch pad when navigating chrome ."}
{"input": "this thing is still fantastic for what it is ."}
{"input": "i chose to purchase a samsung chromebook this time just to try out a different company and because it was inexpensive ( i paid $ 189 ."}
{"input": "i couldn ' t be happier with this product !"}
{"input": "the screen hinge is super strong and it ' s hard to imagine it breaking unless you dropped it ."}
{"input": "the size is perfect , it ' s easy to toss it in my satchel or backpack along with my textbook and notebooks and have plenty of room ."}
{"input": "works great right out of the box , as advertised ."}
{"input": "the battery life on this seems good ."}
{"input": "this chromebook instantly connects to the internet ."}
{"input": "going to a grocery store or fitness center , the android tablets took so long to connect that i finished my shopping before they came online ."}
{"input": "everything is perfect ."}
{"input": "powers up immediately , great battery life , great keyboard , amazing features ."}
{"input": "was considering an apple product but i ' m much happier with this !"}
{"input": "this is my third samsung chromebook and i will continue to use this brand ."}
{"input": "does not act like a tablet , but it can have almost 10 tabs open before affecting performance , including video streaming ."}
{"input": "this was purchased for my son to download his high school textbooks for use ."}
{"input": "great price for a good book used for college students who carry all day"}
{"input": "i bought this refurbished and haven ' t experienced any issues ."}
{"input": "this laptop is very straight forward ."}
{"input": "otherwise , it ' s great ."}
{"input": "also , secure os ."}
{"input": "the product itself is awesome ."}
{"input": "great little laptop and tablet !"}
{"input": "the chormebook works as described by seller ."}
{"input": "i like the size and features ."}
{"input": "however , still 5 stars as you get what you pay for : a cheap , decently rugged , light weight notebook to kick around and tinker with ."}
{"input": "love the keyboard ."}
{"input": "i am still getting use to the chromebook but i love it lightweight easy to bring with me as it doesnt take up much room !"}
{"input": "i am so glad i purchased this and would definitely purchase again ."}
{"input": "since it is the same platform used at school the navigation was easy to get used too ."}
{"input": "great for going on the internet ."}
{"input": "it works well for her ."}
{"input": "we ran world of tank blitz ( using a game controller ) and roblocks on the low rez settings and experienced great appearance and ability to play ."}
{"input": "another little thing is the speaker isn ' t loud ."}
{"input": "love it"}
{"input": "great battery life ."}
{"input": "easy to take with and do homework on the go too !"}
{"input": "i would recommend it to anyone ."}
{"input": "this is perfect ."}
{"input": "battery life , speed , display and software were my additional top reasons why i went for the samsung ."}
{"input": "the display is crisp and bright , setup literally takes under a minute , its fast , cheap , charges fast , lasts forever ."}
{"input": "nice , i ordered this just for simple web browsing and personal use ."}
{"input": "i love my chromebook ."}
{"input": "it is taking me a while to get used to the small , tight keyboard ."}
{"input": "after researching for a high quality laptop that would not break the bank , i finally chose this one ."}
{"input": "delivery was a bit off but i blame usps on that , they suck in my area ."}
{"input": "amd a12 processor is quite fast when loading everything from an ssd ."}
{"input": "light for its size , not much flex in the body ."}
{"input": "stop what you ' re doing now and get this computer !"}
{"input": "this computer is the best thing you can get under 400 dollars ."}
{"input": "great functioning computer ."}
{"input": "excellent laptop at a reasonable price ."}
{"input": "this laptop does all i need it to do ."}
{"input": "works flawlessly and decent battery life ."}
{"input": "excelente laptop"}
{"input": "great for graphics , nothing to complex but it can get the job done"}
{"input": "about what i was expecting / hoping it to be ."}
{"input": "it has been able to handle everything i ' ve needed for my business ."}
{"input": "it is fast enough for what we do , and it has all the features we needed for less ."}
{"input": "love our new laptop ."}
{"input": "battery could last longer ."}
{"input": "light weight , good battery life , sharp screen ."}
{"input": "he is very content with it and its features"}
{"input": "great performance , quiet and cool processor ."}
{"input": "the sims 4 ran very smoothly on regular graphics ."}
{"input": "i was really excited to get this laptop !"}
{"input": "runs first person shooters relatively well ."}
{"input": "would definitely buy this again if i needed to do so ."}
{"input": "laptop booted right up and the set up waa super easy ."}
{"input": "the ones that do , doesn ' t have the numbering pad on the right side of the keyboard and i needed that ."}
{"input": "it ' s a very good lappy and i ' m happy with it , because it can still get all i need to do , done ."}
{"input": "nice and thin , light , surprised it has a dvd player in it ."}
{"input": "for my needs it ' s a perfect computer with one major flaw : battery life is much shorter than they advertise !"}
{"input": "mine did lose its screen backlight suddenly when i ' d had it less than a month ."}
{"input": "fast processor ."}
{"input": "if you want a laptop ( not for gaming - reviews say - i have not tried ) get this one !"}
{"input": "i think the battery is just undersized for the amd a12 apu ."}
{"input": "this is an excellent laptop with a lot of heart ."}
{"input": "the dvd player is a really nice touch as well , i didn ' t think i would use it but i definitely will in the future !"}
{"input": "has all the available ports that i need ."}
{"input": "laptop is very fast with 4cpu and 8gpu on board ."}
{"input": "great computer , you can play 2015 and below games on this computer ."}
{"input": "great laptop !"}
{"input": "she can stream music or videos , do her homework , and so on , so we are all pleased with our purchase ."}
{"input": "cpu performance does well ."}
{"input": "i bought this for college to do my homework and also pay my bills ."}
{"input": "really like it ."}
{"input": "played heroes of the storm with graphics up full and wasn ' t any lag ."}
{"input": "webpages load quickly ."}
{"input": "but i guess , it ' s got a lot of power going to that processor so you can ' t have it all ."}
{"input": "for us , it was perfect ."}
{"input": "i got ta say this was my first ever online computer / laptop order and let me tell you its pretty good ."}
{"input": "i love how sleek and thin it is ."}
{"input": "great feel to the keyboard as well ."}
{"input": "this is a super fast computer and i really like it ."}
{"input": "it ' s so far a solid laptop that i can use for some gaming and school ."}
{"input": "i purchased the laptop in august , and i already have a couple of keys popping off ."}
{"input": "i almost always keep it plugged in , so i can ' t comment on battery life ."}
{"input": "battery life is short , but plugging it in works ."}
{"input": "sleek design ."}
{"input": "easy to use ."}
{"input": "nice computer for responsible grade school child ."}
{"input": "this laptop is well engineered and designed ."}
{"input": "this is a very nice laptop ."}
{"input": "it is perfect for everything i need it for ."}
{"input": "provided just what i wanted at a resonable price ."}
{"input": "this laptop is fast and does what i need without problems ."}
{"input": "great price and great performance but terrible battery ."}
{"input": "it is a little slow ."}
{"input": "great computer , setup was fast and easy ."}
{"input": "i am inlove with this laptop literally , it ' s nice size 15 ."}
{"input": "graphics are good for the level of this laptop ."}
{"input": "finally got the warranty honored after almost 6 months ."}
{"input": "plenty of buyer returned it since the touch screen has phantom touch problems right after unboxing or it will eventually happen within 3 months ."}
{"input": "consequently , i am no longer covered and my otherwise great chromebook becomes unusable anytime the phantom touches appear ."}
{"input": "i have tried to fix the pixel with online videos and websites with no effect ."}
{"input": "the beautiful screen is said to be identical to the pixelbook in size , aspect ratio , and resolution ."}
{"input": "after using the 3 : 2 aspect ratio , i think i prefer it to normal 16 : 9 , as far as chromebooks go ."}
{"input": "it was fine for a solid two days , from there on it has been nonstop , reset to factory settings ."}
{"input": "idk if that ' s how chromeos usually is , or maybe there is something wrong with the hardware but this is very annoying ."}
{"input": "i get that this is meant to store everything in the cloud so it should be no big deal , but when your trying to get work done where there is no access to the internet ( since google docs works offline ) it is practically useless when it has to reset itself to factory settings just after turning it on ."}
{"input": "the touch screen works wonderfully ."}
{"input": "as others have noted , the backspace key is small ."}
{"input": "my biggest irk today though is that the screen is not very durable ."}
{"input": "hard reboot , reset , refresh + power , esc + refresh + power , charging , letting it drain , nothing brought it back to life ."}
{"input": "needless to say trip number three to best buy was a pure return , since being 0 / 2 on such an expensive device leaves a bad taste , you know ?"}
{"input": "gorgeous screen , small profile , lightweight , built in stylus , i could go on and on about how awesome this thing was ."}
{"input": "this review might be dismissed as i am missing the ` ` verified purchase ` ` stamp , which is fair ."}
{"input": "i wouldn ' t recommend this as a starting computer for children because they ' d learn incorrect navigation and have to adapt later to standard laptops ."}
{"input": "look , dont buy it ."}
{"input": "the screen does look good ."}
{"input": "terrible quality and not really enjoyable to use apps on the playstore ."}
{"input": "battery life its ok ."}
{"input": "then i got it home , worked with it for awhile , and realized just how easy it is to misfire unless you land dead nuts center in the middle of the key on your stroke ."}
{"input": "another star off for android app support , which simply isn ' t ready for prime time ."}
{"input": "i didn ' t find a single android app that was optimized for chrome os ( not that my search was exhaustive , admittedly ) , so was disappointed pretty much every time ."}
{"input": "battery life was mediocre , too , come to think of it ."}
{"input": "amazon gave me the option of returning for refund or trying to have it repaired ."}
{"input": "battery is good , display and keyboard are pretty great ."}
{"input": "there ' s nothing ` ` pro ` ` about this tablet ."}
{"input": "unless it ' s a really bad baby and chromeos + samsung = bad baby !"}
{"input": "sounds nice until you realize that your computer just doesn ' t let you do things and then calls it secure ."}
{"input": "the keyboard lacks a backlight which is inconvenient in low light situations ."}
{"input": "when you stack up all these strengths and offer them at a price of $ 299 , you ' re getting a fairly impressive value proposition here with this chromebook ."}
{"input": "at $ 300 , this is a great purchase ."}
{"input": "which leads me to my next point , the omnipresent comments about ` ` this feels like a $ 1000 computer ! ` `"}
{"input": "this isn ' t say the acer is bad in the abstract ; far from it ."}
{"input": "it has a nice , oversize trackpad that - like pretty much all chromebooks - is responsive and a pleasure to use ."}
{"input": "the performance never lags , it meets the 10 - 12 hour battery life promise in my usage tests , and it ' s quickly become my go - to computer for both home and work ."}
{"input": "this unit not only has a nice aluminum shell ( which is very attractive ) , but it also has a decent keyboard , with much better tactile properties than any chromebooks i ' ve looked at in the past ."}
{"input": "when i was comparing this model against other manufacturer ' s / model ' s , the only thing that made me pause was the lack of a card reader / writer ."}
{"input": "i love it !"}
{"input": "this isn ' t a powerhouse , i ' ve never pushed it , it probably wouldn ' t handle the 20 + tabs over multiple windows / desktops that i ' m used to on chrome on the desktop , but for 99 % of ` ` regular people ` ` this is an unbelievably good laptop ."}
{"input": "the battery life is incredible and charges from 0 % to 100 % in about an hour and a half while in use ."}
{"input": "overall , it performs well enough for my daily internet needs ."}
{"input": "my only wish is that it were a little more quick / less laggy given it is a chromebook - but for the price point its a great buy ."}
{"input": "little bit of a learning curve with chrome os ."}
{"input": "so it appears the play store does not recognize this devise at this time ."}
{"input": "chromebook seems like the kind of device that you review after a few weeks , and by the time anything happens to it that affects use , the replacement will be just as much or cheaper , twice as powerful , and come with ` ` angry birds ` ` installed by default ."}
{"input": "the hdmi and usb ports are on the left side , the back has no ports at all , and , misery !"}
{"input": "the initial feel for this chromebook is superb ."}
{"input": "the quad - core celeron n3160 gets a respectable near - 8000 octane score ."}
{"input": "this is a solid , well - balanced design ."}
{"input": "first time chromebook user , and this has been my favorite laptop ever ."}
{"input": "i ' m been quite pleased at how well the chromebook has worked for all these tasks ."}
{"input": "as for software , chromeos is a decent thin - client operating system which can do more than most people think ."}
{"input": "i was hesitant at first because of the price , but i have to say that this is honestly an amazing machine ."}
{"input": "secondly , this is a really aesthetically pleasing machine ."}
{"input": "there are , as with everything , several growth opportunities for this model ."}
{"input": "secondly , the trackpad feels a bit delicate ."}
{"input": "the battery is good ."}
{"input": "if you are looking for a laptop to check emails , watch movies , to shop , basic documentation , then this is an ideal one ."}
{"input": "i have had q & a on this chromebook asking if it will download ms office ."}
{"input": "battery seems to be pretty good ."}
{"input": "with the slow celeron processor , browsing does not feel snappy ."}
{"input": "this is my second chromebook and my next purchase will be a chromebase to replace my home pc ."}
{"input": "it does everything that i need and is surprisingly fast ."}
{"input": "i want to cry because this doesn ' t support google play store !"}
{"input": "i ' m a graphic designer / gamer and my creative software operates with no problems and i ' m able to play the sims 4 and world of warcraft on very high settings with no problems at all ."}
{"input": "this is a huge plus !"}
{"input": "- drives are now solid state drive ."}
{"input": "- new built - in speakers ."}
{"input": "- no dvd drive ."}
{"input": "i couldn ' t drag - and - drop items in it , but after i changed the behavior in settings , everything went well from there ."}
{"input": "it is pretty light if you are coming from any other laptop ."}
{"input": "very sharp screen and good viewing angles ."}
{"input": "something about os x running with a high resolution display just looks classy in a way that a windows computer could never match ."}
{"input": "no complaints here ."}
{"input": "this computer is blazing fast ."}
{"input": "with os x yosemite , the os is very refined and elegant ."}
{"input": "the laptop works great and the package was delivered on time ."}
{"input": "this thing is fast and efficient ."}
{"input": "this computer is very high quality , do not believe anything on the market can touch it ."}
{"input": "the backlighting is comparable , but the mbp gets brighter ."}
{"input": "the thunderbolt ports are a nice thing to have on the mbp ."}
{"input": "the best laptop i ' ve owned ."}
{"input": "bought it for my grandson for college and he loves it ."}
{"input": "overall , this is an excellent machine ."}
{"input": "good durability , outstanding performance and portability ."}
{"input": "response is excellent ."}
{"input": "- battery life appears to be excellent"}
{"input": "- laptop is light ."}
{"input": "- generous selection of ports ( this is in reference to the newer model )"}
{"input": "- laptop is sleek and dare i say , sexy"}
{"input": "i enjoy the processing speed of this model ."}
{"input": "fast shipping , product exactly as described , authentic apple , new , factory sealed in box ."}
{"input": "loving the sharp display and the track pad ."}
{"input": "i am in love with how light and speedy it is ."}
{"input": "i love this macbook ."}
{"input": "great product"}
{"input": "this is an amazing computer i bought from cellelectronics ."}
{"input": "they put a lot of thought and work into making sure that the hardware and software work real well together ."}
{"input": "obviously great computer"}
{"input": "very nice laptop , i love its portable feature and the running speed is very fast ."}
{"input": "the only issue i have with it ( and hence the four star rating ) is the battery life ."}
{"input": "it is thinner , and lighter ."}
{"input": "awesome computer ."}
{"input": "the shipping was fast and the seller was great"}
{"input": "the mac is great besides a chip under the mouse pad ."}
{"input": "the design is beautiful and the force feedback track pad is amazing ."}
{"input": "yeah the new mac book is lighter and only a little small but the internals are a lot slower ."}
{"input": "love this computer !"}
{"input": "force touch trackpad , pretty freakin awesome ."}
{"input": "works like a charm and the retina display is super gorgeous ."}
{"input": "the laptop arrived in excellent condition ."}
{"input": "i absolutely love the programs that come with it ; how the mac itself functions , the appearance and quality of the mac ."}
{"input": "battery life thus far isn ' t nearly as long as i thought it would be , based upon video reviews of this model and item description ."}
{"input": "this macbook is such a blessing and i would feel somewhat lost without it ."}
{"input": "if you ' re considering getting this macbook , proceed with confidence ."}
{"input": "the ss hard drive has next to zero lag over traditional drives ."}
{"input": "it ' s far away from meeting my expectations ."}
{"input": "i really like how it isn ' t bulky ."}
{"input": "great price and customer service"}
{"input": "however , i have an iphone and an ipad and the macbook does a great job syncing up everything on all three devises ."}
{"input": "laptop works perfect however i did get a used charger that only lasted a week ."}
{"input": "awesome machine ."}
{"input": "costs a few bucks $ $ $ more but apple products are the best on the market ."}
{"input": "this computer is great for playing videos in a classroom setting of 10 people , connecting to an hdmi tv to show videos and powerpoints , and has a fantastic battery life ."}
{"input": "great price ."}
{"input": "great computer !"}
{"input": "i ' ve been using this laptop for 1 year and no issues with the deliver nor the computer ."}
{"input": "great prodcut"}
{"input": "i did not like the new 2016 model due to the lack of ports and magsafe connector ."}
{"input": "shipping was fast and product came as described ."}
{"input": "apple updates are easy ."}
{"input": "it arrived in great condition , and it ' s been working perfectly for me since i got it ."}
{"input": "high quaility computer in every way ."}
{"input": "i like this machine quite a bit ."}
{"input": "i was initially a little nervous as the system was somewhat glitchy for the first couple of weeks , seemed to be a problem with the chrome os because it was fixed by the next update ."}
{"input": "took a week or so to get used to , but love it now ."}
{"input": "screen stays in whatever position you put it solidly enough to use the touchscreen ."}
{"input": "battery : solid ."}
{"input": "- speakers are a little tinny ( though the volume is awesome ) and it ' s not possible to customize the equalizer on the chrome os right now : ("}
{"input": "i mean , if you want a true tablet , buy a true tablet - - this did honestly keep me from investing in a kindle as i was planning to ."}
{"input": "i love that it is only as big as it needs to be to have a full - size keyboard ( not with a number pad , but full - sized keys ) ."}
{"input": "update it as soon as you turn it on !"}
{"input": "my trusty windows 7 laptop was on its last leg and i opted to try something new ."}
{"input": "however , it comes with 100 gb of free google drive online storage ."}
{"input": "the touchscreen looks good and is responsive , and the keyboard is nice ."}
{"input": "people who complain that chromebooks are useless without internet access clearly are narrow minded and simply not thinking outside the box ."}
{"input": "so i went to install my favorite screenwriting app , trelby , only to find its not available ."}
{"input": "maybe this thing does suck without an internet connection ."}
{"input": "and just like that , i realized that i can use my studio desktop wherever i want , whenever i want ."}
{"input": "it does make quite a loud click when you depress the button ."}
{"input": "overall : i like it and am happy for paying a bit over $ 200 for the 4gb model ( at the time of writing this , it sells for $ 220 new ) ."}
{"input": "one plus i ' m particularly happy about : a quiet fan - less device that doesn ' t heat up too much !"}
{"input": "i have to say , i was somewhat hesitant purchasing this chromebook mainly because of some of the reviews ."}
{"input": "due to the excellent return policy on prime i decided to purchase this ."}
{"input": "i downloaded pandora and listened to all my stations at 3 / 4 volume and it sounded fine ."}
{"input": "so far all but 1 of the android apps that i have tried have functioned properly , but some are restricted in the size of window that will work properly ."}
{"input": "laptop arrived dirty ( grimy screen and there was actual pet hair in the air vent ) ."}
{"input": "i had to look up keys to press to get into a start up mode to even set up the computer"}
{"input": "i am not blaming the seller , i am blaming mac ' s os and its glitchy services ."}
{"input": "but currently i am happy with it , the battery is ok , and its very aesthetically pleasing ."}
{"input": "ordered a macbook pro 13inch 256gb from this seller and with the exception of the power button , the keyboard and the trackpad wasn ' t working ."}
{"input": "the seller ' s description is that it was ` ` tested and fully functional ` ` and it wasn ' t ."}
{"input": "update : apparently the laptop sold to me was missing 5 screws on the inside that actually holds everything together ."}
{"input": "while yes , the charger does look great coming out of the box , plan on buying another shortly thereafter - and after , as long as your patience holds up ."}
{"input": "do not waste your time calling apple to see if there is anything they can do about it after 1 year ( unless of course you want to pay even more money on ' apple care ' ) ."}
{"input": "as much as i love the computer , and tout macbook to all my friends , for me , it stops here and now ."}
{"input": "the anti - reflective coating will wear off and it isn ' t covered under apple ' s warranty ."}

{"input": "2 usb ports and 2 thunderbolt ports on a $ 4500nz laptop ?"}
{"input": "the ` ` ssd drive ` ` is not user replaceable ."}
{"input": "the charger is defective and after 45 days of use the charger is shot ."}
{"input": "first impressions , excellent looking laptop and very light !"}
{"input": "i love the keyboard and the trackpad - i finally get it now why both of these have rave reviews ."}
{"input": "the battery life is good - i get about 5 - 6 hours of non stop typing , with 3 browsers opened and wifi always on ."}
{"input": "it ' s not stated anywhere that ' s it ' s used ."}
{"input": "didn ' t purchase from amazon but i can not believe these laptops have 5 stars ."}
{"input": "then one day , it stopped booting ."}
{"input": "my daughter loves it and it will be a great tool to help her through nursing school ."}
{"input": "apparently apple isn ' t even trying anymore ."}
{"input": "* very good battery life"}
{"input": "it is not worth it ."}
{"input": "i ' m still absolutely blown away how apple , a supposed industry leader , has such horrendous functionality ."}
{"input": "i purchased this notebook back in july and was initially happy with my purchase ."}
{"input": "after numerous calls , i then received confirmation the warranty was valid , but only as a \u2018 one - off ' ."}
{"input": "asus , has a horrible reputation ."}
{"input": "my final verdict - it ' s somewhat solid as a device now that 6 months of updates and delays are behind us ."}
{"input": "bright enough for all uses , and 1080p is perfect - images are sharp ."}
{"input": "- battery life is solid , right around what is claimed - probably 7 to 10 hours depending on variables such as screen brightness and how demanding you ' re being with it ."}
{"input": "- touchscreen is responsive enough for gaming ."}
{"input": "i absolutely imagine chrome apps picking up drastically in quality and quantity now , since it seems like chrome os is really coming into its own this year ."}
{"input": "- in tablet mode , the screen looks too \u2018 tall ' to feel natural ( see the attached picture ) ."}
{"input": "this screen ratio makes it look great in desktop mode ."}
{"input": "after 3 months of use the unit will no longer charge ."}
{"input": "if it is indeed a software thing and it ' s fixed , i would highly recommend this device ."}
{"input": "second issue is with scaling of the ui ."}
{"input": "the screen itself is hd 1080p but most ui elements don ' t look good in this resolution ."}
{"input": "unless the app is specifically designed to access google drive files , the app has no way to read and save files directly to the cloud ."}
{"input": "\u2022 great battery life ."}
{"input": "\u2022 volume is incredibly low ."}
{"input": "i would like a quick fix but have not found one that would allow me to consider keeping this beautiful asus chromebook ."}
{"input": "then i one night i plugged it in and woke up to a dead chromebook ."}
{"input": "it ' s too heavy to really use as a tablet ."}
{"input": "transfer speeds ( lan to nas ) were miserably slow ( 10 - 30mbps ) ."}
{"input": "it was perfect with no backlight bleed , no shimmery matte texture , no uneven backlight , no dead / stuck pixels ."}
{"input": "this product was fantastic - - great build quality , screen resolution , keyboard - - until one day it stopped turning on ."}
{"input": "i ' ve been repairing products for years and it was clear this was a power _ supply issue ."}
{"input": "if this device weren ' t nearly $ 500 i might expect it to only last a year , but at this price point it ' s unacceptable ."}
{"input": "some of the things i wanted to do with this notebook were limited by the os ."}
{"input": "the laptop was great , lightweight , booted fast , simple to use ."}
{"input": "even just this last month it still rates ( on several tech sites ) as one of the best overall chromebook lines to get ."}
{"input": "the asus customer service people are rude and have no answers ."}
{"input": "things were fine until the unit stopped charging ."}
{"input": "this is the problem with companies today ."}
{"input": "asus customer service sucks ."}
{"input": "i call customer service , first they argue and say customer damage then to try and placate me they say they have an adp accidental damage and protection plan one time for one year ."}
{"input": "it is a beautiful , well built laptop ."}
{"input": "that ' s nutty for an expensive premium product ."}
{"input": "asus what the heck were you thinking when you designed this product ?"}
{"input": "i seriously love the product but i may have to return it ."}
{"input": "now i only leave it charging until it ' s full but the battery time is still decreasing ."}
{"input": "very impressed with my first chromebook ."}
{"input": "i don ' t use it as much in tablet mode as i thought as it is a little heavy when in that configuration ."}
{"input": "i had high hopes for this tablet / computer based on customer reviews ."}
{"input": "google docs work fine ."}
{"input": "a chromebook does most of what i need , except gaiming ."}
{"input": "second , and most annoying , it would not identify my printer in cloud print ."}
{"input": "so , guess i ' m screwed , because now after 6 months my tpm is no longer working and the whole computer is useless ."}
{"input": "product is sturdy , lightweight , fast , and the battery runtime was as advertised !"}
{"input": "i had to buy a mouse because the touchpad is very sticky ."}
{"input": "not at all pleasant to use also , the screen quality is just so - so ."}
{"input": "and not buy any asus product again"}
{"input": "the third one is ok but has a dead pixel ."}
{"input": "i ' ve contacted amazon and asus and no response ."}
{"input": "this piece of crap won ' t hold a wifi signal or has a really weak signal ."}
{"input": "several of my chrome extensions perform poorly and have to be disabled altogether which degrades my work production experience ."}
{"input": "however , 1 ) the speakers on this thing are horrible ."}
{"input": "battery life is not good ."}
{"input": "but screen is very weird ."}
{"input": "the intel m3 processor is amazing , this thing can do a ton of multi - tasking and the google play store is nice to have , the android apps variants trump the chromebook pre - loaded apps ."}
{"input": "a great chromebook , but stopped charging in 3 months ."}
{"input": "i was really excited to purchase this product because it was more affordable ."}
{"input": "chromebooks are cool , but they dont last at all ."}
{"input": "hey this machine is extremely useable and functionable ."}
{"input": "battery no longer charging ."}
{"input": "furthermore , the file system is extremely complicated to use ."}
{"input": "the display panel on the machine i received is warped ."}
{"input": "half the time it doesn ' t want to turn on and just flashes ."}
{"input": "the machine looks great from the hardware point , but the whole concept of chrome os and cloud applications sucks ."}
{"input": "in the middle of using , it rebooted , then went into an endless boot loop , so i tried to reset it to factory default , now it says chrome os is missing or damaged ."}
{"input": "the screen hinge feels weak ."}
{"input": "screen is average by 2017 standards ."}
{"input": "the chromebook is brilliant overall ."}
{"input": "google provides zeros customer support related to the os ."}
{"input": "horrible product ."}
{"input": "tech support is no help unless you are willing to part with your computer for months without guarantee of return ."}
{"input": "i am having a very difficult time with this chromebook ."}
{"input": "it freezes constantly and needs to be shut off to start again ."}
{"input": "the microphone does not work with regular speaker ."}
{"input": "the tablet mode is horribly integrated with the os and applications ."}
{"input": "i tried returning the second one bu it does n ' t give me the option to return it ."}
{"input": "this is nothing more than an okay laptop to get you through basic work activities ."}
{"input": "overall it ' s one of the nicest chrombooks out there ."}
{"input": "however , mine came with an annoying trackpad ."}
{"input": "the top metal monitor casing seems to be soft and bendable ."}
{"input": "mine arrived with the metal screen casing slightly bent , i can easily bend it back , not sure about the durability of this thing in the long term ."}
{"input": "however , shortly after i received it , a buzzing sound started coming out of the right side usb port ."}
{"input": "so chromebook with some manufacturing issues + bad customer service"}
{"input": "they 1080 screen makes the fonts to small for this size screen ."}
{"input": "i find the chromium os to be very limiting and would not recommend it over a cheap windows pc ."}
{"input": "the keyboard is fantastic , but it ' s just a keyboard ."}
{"input": "the touchpad is also some strange off color plastic ."}
{"input": "1 - faulty trackpad resulting in jerky erratic cursor movement relative to the smooth movement of your finger ."}
{"input": "i then noticed a dead pixel on the screen ."}
{"input": "however , if you want a really speedy chromebook , it ' s great ."}
{"input": "the first unit i received shortly died after a few hours of usage ."}
{"input": "i like the addition of the cooler boost button , but most of the time i don ' t have to use it because i have a thermaltake auto laptop cooling pad that monitors the bottom surface of my laptop ."}
{"input": "trackpad is ok ."}
{"input": "wireless card is finicky with both units i had ."}
{"input": "my laptop seems to lose its internet connection at random times ."}
{"input": "after being on the phone with technical support and windows support for a combined 10 hours , i am told that the hardware is defective and must be replaced ."}
{"input": "run like heck from this machine ."}
{"input": "it will break , even if it works at first ."}
{"input": "this laptop isn ' t even 30 days old yet ."}
{"input": "literally just closing it and opening it up later was a 50 / 50 proposition if it would wake up , or the display would crash , or the disk would crash , or some driver would fail - on a brand new laptop ."}
{"input": "hook up the cat5 and the machine is screaming at high speed and exactly what i was hoping for ."}
{"input": "by the time i was returning it , the system was in such poor shape from the msi ."}
{"input": "i believe if you happen to uninstall / install the drivers in exactly the correct order and / or do a clean win 10 installation yourself , this laptop should perform well for the price ."}
{"input": "the sound is really terrible and tinny ."}
{"input": "it ' s fast ."}
{"input": "excellent product"}
{"input": "i ' ve always liked msi for their performance and fairly decent price ."}
{"input": "it was actually more like 1h45m and this was also after optimizing the battery ."}
{"input": "so , four days after buying this laptop , it stopped booting ."}
{"input": "for the four days i used it , it worked pretty good ."}
{"input": "this laptop is not worth the time and definitely not the money ."}
{"input": "we call tech support together and the guy who answers is just so not interested in helping ."}
{"input": "i am extremely disappointed with this laptop ."}
{"input": "update : this is by far and away the worst computer i have ever purchased ."}
{"input": "got the second laptop , died within a month and same thing ."}
{"input": "this kept plaguing the laptop as more problems kept piling up including various bsod errors mostly involving the hardware ."}
{"input": "poor design and terrible tech support ."}
{"input": "this computer is amazing !"}
{"input": "quite like this laptop so far , only writing this review so early from owning it to receive that nice msi headset ."}
{"input": "not too happy with msi , likely to return this laptop ."}
{"input": "this laptop was great starting out of the box ."}
{"input": "their support page is very buggy , and the support people are unhelpful ."}
{"input": "sooooo i would avoid this and i ' m pretty much avoiding the optane drive which may have been part of the issue ."}
{"input": "after this issue i finally decided to return my product ."}
{"input": "good luck this customer tech support and msi has absolutely no idea how to help you ."}
{"input": "i ' ve had to do a factory reset on this piece of garbage 4 times and i ' ve only owned it for 4 months ."}
{"input": "you can feel the plastic bending if you pick up the laptop with one hand ."}
{"input": "i really loved this laptop ."}
{"input": "i will never own another msi product ."}
{"input": "now i feel bad buying this for my child , as this laptop seem to have a solid rating elsewhere ."}
{"input": "so i ' m stuck with a 3 month old laptop that does n ' t work ."}
{"input": "eventually got to the point that even when i reinstalled windows it was so slow that there are clearly serious build defects / instabilities on this product ."}
{"input": "when it is functioning it works great ."}
{"input": "finding out you bought garbage for the steep price of $ 700 + ."}
{"input": "overall a decent laptop if not for these problems , also , the laptop has minor screen freezes even while playing low graphical games like league of legends ."}
{"input": "laptop malfunctioned and stopped working after only 3 months ."}
{"input": "it does have a nice screen that is very bright , decent viewing angle and ok for contrast ."}
{"input": "the keyboard is very nice and very responsive ."}
{"input": "i love the fast bootup time with the optane memory , a nice alternative to a very expensive ssd ."}
{"input": "the charge doesn ' t last like the five hours it stated but instead last three hours ."}
{"input": "had it for a month and it ' s riddled with problems ."}
{"input": "as others have said , the only downside is the slow 5400 rpm 1 tb hard drive ."}
{"input": "+ very good ips matte fhd panel , zero reflections , almost zero light bleed , average brightness ."}
{"input": "used as bought , it is an ok laptop , but not great ( probably a 3 star value ) ."}
{"input": "- no ethernet port ( not that i ' ve used or needed one that i can recall )"}
{"input": "no backlit keyboard ."}
{"input": "it has plenty of power for most tasks ."}
{"input": "the only weak point of the laptop is the hard drive it come with , but luckily this laptop is extendable - 2 ram slots and one m ."}
{"input": "i paid $ 500 for a 15 ` ` notebook with 8gb ram , latest i5 - 8250u cpu with reasonable weight and its quite extendable , i am happy for this deal ."}
{"input": "also , i ' m not a fan of the delete and power button being next to each other , now i see what the other people are complaining about accidentally shutting it off ."}
{"input": "haven ' t had any issues yet so pretty glad i chose this ."}
{"input": "very nice looking laptop for the money ."}
{"input": "features windows 10 , sharp display , and card slot for m ."}
{"input": "great quality computer ."}
{"input": "like the flip , this has good build quality ."}
{"input": "so far it has been able to handle everything i ' ve thrown at it ."}
{"input": "all in all , pretty good stuff ."}
{"input": "2 and this laptop is an epic powerhouse for under $ 700 ."}
{"input": "very good laptop if you want something lightweight for everyday browsing ."}
{"input": "excellent hardware , however i ran into some nasty trouble after updating windows 10 ."}
{"input": "so , shortly after buying it i had to format it ."}
{"input": "and just now , the computer says it is plugged in but not charging ."}
{"input": "the fingerprint reader works most of the time ."}
{"input": "the sound is fine for me but not as good as external speakers ."}
{"input": "not that this machine boots up slow ."}
{"input": "great value for a laptop ."}
{"input": "love the 15 inch screen in the body of a 14 inch body ."}
{"input": "cheaply made plastic but performance is well worth the trade for a $ 500 laptop ."}
{"input": "touchpad works well ."}
{"input": "the speakers are mediocre and don ' t put out too much volume and are sensitive to position ."}
{"input": "i do like the screen on this , images are clean and crisp , enjoying the 4 gigs of ram which allow me to have a few more tab open ."}
{"input": "i like how it ' s so simple , without so much clutter and complexity ."}
{"input": "i ' m still keeping this as a backup or additional laptop because of its cheap price ."}
{"input": "anyways , i really would of liked to have kept the chromebook as it was the perfect weight , size , and design for my upcoming college semester ."}
{"input": "laptop would never power on , even after being charged for 24 hours ."}
{"input": "i want to love this laptop because it is so lightweight and sleek ."}
{"input": "it ' s decent ."}
{"input": "ssd hardware issue"}
{"input": "note : support for amazon is making it good and immediately sent me the return label , bought through third party but i will get my money back , thank god for amazon customer service"}
{"input": "the return procedure is so elaborate that i may decide to just write this purchase up as one big mistake ."}
{"input": "daughter opened it for christmas and it doesn ' t stay on ."}
{"input": "they keyboard felt responsive and was a good size ."}
{"input": "i am very close to just returning it and never buying another acer product ever again ."}
{"input": "i will give them props for the build quality ."}
{"input": "combine these items together and this item became very frustrating ."}
{"input": "- exceptional keyboard and touchpad feel"}
{"input": "- below average screen brightness about 200 nits , average is 250 - 275 ."}
{"input": "as you can see from the reviews it worked out fine for most people ."}
{"input": "when i sent it back to acer to repair it they simply claimed it had water damaging and couldn ' t fix it ."}
{"input": "my acer aspire e 15 worked great for a day , and then shut off by itself ."}
{"input": "by june 2018 , the keyboard stopped working , and i had to do an unplug and reboot ."}
{"input": "now given that without the issue they are a nice laptop ."}
{"input": "good performance for the price and my intention as the support for my family was to have everyone on these with a spare to deal with ones that break down ."}
{"input": "i purchased this computer because it came highly rated by consumer reports , pc magazine , and other raters ."}
{"input": "the reason why i ' m giving this laptop a two star is because overall i think the quality of it is good especially for the price ."}
{"input": "can not remove the battery ."}
{"input": "i too have the black screen problem ."}
{"input": "computer is fine but the speakers broke after 1 week of use ."}
{"input": "the computer is good for the price , but the hdmi port is already broken ."}
{"input": "won ' t turn on , won ' t charge , have to send it to tx to be repaired ."}
{"input": "i want to insist that this is not a game laptop , as many have reviewed it as ."}
{"input": "battery life can last me roughly 5 or 6 hours on internet usage alone with multiple tabs ."}
{"input": "the speakers on the bottom take a moment to get used to but after that it ' s alright ."}
{"input": "also , i hate the keyboard - it feels really cheap ."}
{"input": "overall the laptop is cheap and flimsy ."}
{"input": "mx150 gaphics card is also pretty bad ."}
{"input": "and i genuinely believed in acer , but first i had a lot of issues setting up the computer and after hours of customer service help the touch pad did n ' t even work ."}
{"input": "i took it to my local computer repair who states it has a bad board ."}
{"input": "there ' s something wrong with my laptop ."}
{"input": "something is wrong with the power management ."}
{"input": "very disappointed in the $ 600 e 15 , as opposed to the no frills , plain old , < $ 200 15 i ' ve had for 2 ."}
{"input": "the trackpad stopped working after four weeks of using it ."}
{"input": "there is a flicker in the middle of the screen that is very annoying ."}
{"input": "the computer runs decent but the keypad turns off every time the computer sleeps ."}
{"input": "otherwise , so far it is working well ."}
{"input": "i presented my son with a gift of a defective machine ."}
{"input": "the computer itself is actually quite fast with the ssd and processor , so my experience there so far has been good ."}
{"input": "keyboard and track pad shoved way left ."}
{"input": "keyboard rattles loudly when typing on left side ."}
{"input": "will not connect to wifi , amd screen flashes when adjusting while on ."}
{"input": "but the speakers are absolutely horrible !"}
{"input": "latest 8th generation core i5 cpu"}
{"input": "keyboard has flex"}
{"input": "no backlight at keyboard"}
{"input": "key presses are too stiff to press ."}
{"input": "hdd makes this laptop very slow ."}
{"input": "but asus engineers designed the case and laptop not to be opened by users ."}
{"input": "there is no backlight and keys are too stiff ."}
{"input": "i believe it is not healthy to use this keyboard for a long time ."}
{"input": "linux is mostly compatible with this laptop except fingerprint reader ."}
{"input": "video converting process with same video file took only 25 minutes with asus vivobook f510ua ."}
{"input": "3 ) you can hear the screen creak ."}
{"input": "it doesn ' t support a hardwire connection ."}
{"input": "i have installed no software on it yet it updates something every day and wants to reboot ."}
{"input": "it just locked up again ."}
{"input": "did i mention it sounds like a lawn mower ?"}
{"input": "i will say i do enjoy the screen quality , the wifi is fast on this laptop ."}
{"input": "in all , stay away ."}
{"input": "- keyboard is comfortable to use"}
{"input": "- finger doesn ' t side smoothly along track pad ."}
{"input": "horrible laptop !"}
{"input": "i had to spend over $ 160 to return it ."}
{"input": "i will never buy an other asus product ."}
{"input": "it just crashed , dead ."}
{"input": "- the screen looks pretty good , except when viewing anything dark ."}
{"input": "- the keyboard is awful ."}
{"input": "when i asked asus for a replacement key , they said i ' d have to ship it back to them , which would have left me without a computer for 2 weeks ."}
{"input": "don ' t buy it ."}
{"input": "after my 3rd boot up it ' s damaged ."}
{"input": "after a month of use , disk ( c : ) runs at 100 % all the time ."}
{"input": "everything else is very good and i am satisfied"}
{"input": "do not buy this computer if your plan is to multitask , play an occasional game and / or play music while searching the web ."}
{"input": "this is first impression , 1st day using it"}
{"input": "overall good laptop ."}
{"input": "the fingerprint scanner is half jotted and barely works ."}
{"input": "one day of use and the screen turns itself off and logs you out whenever it feels to do so ."}
{"input": "finger print scanner not working whatsoever ."}
{"input": "with all the great spec hardware in this laptop , why would you put a 5400rpm hard drive in this unit ?"}
{"input": "poor touch pad , it get stuck ."}
{"input": "- the physical case is solid and of a production quality you ' d expect in machine 3 - 5x the price of this machine"}
{"input": "- user interfaces that are tight , responsive"}
{"input": "all and all , it ' s a light weight , but very robust development stack , that also has the added convenience of cloud9 ' s collaboration features wherein multiple developers can be writing code in even the same file simultaneously ."}
{"input": "thus far , i ' ve loaded a number of games , my password vault , several productivity apps , skype , spotify and some network scanning android apps and they ' ve all worked very well ."}
{"input": "mouse and trackpad settings are very minimalist , there ' s no way to modify short - cut keys , and the power management options are pretty minimal , too ."}
{"input": "and the google play store is chock - full of great apps and games ."}
{"input": "it ' s really seamless and smooth to move back and forth and makes experimenting with different linux configs and environments effortless ."}
{"input": "you won ' t be disappointed with this great little machine how ever you end up using it , and that versatility is what really makes this machine such a fun and valuable computer ."}
{"input": "for ~ $ 15 you can get a nice , fitted anti - glare screen protector that reduces the fingerprint / glare problems and gives you some piece of mind about protecting that gorgeous screen ."}
{"input": "i saw this c302 was announced at ces and was immediately drawn to it since it has the intel core m3 processor ."}
{"input": "apps like microsoft word , excel , etc run wonderfully ."}
{"input": "for instance , the android youtube app doesn ' t work well at all because it ' s very inconvenient to get videos into full - screen mode ."}
{"input": "it seems pretty fast ."}
{"input": "so i ' m very happy and relieved to see it working excellently on the c302 ."}
{"input": "this is easily the best overall chromebook out there right now ( under $ 500 ) ."}
{"input": "* battery * - battery life is great ."}
{"input": "the backlight works great and i had no problems using it in the dark ."}
{"input": "it ' s a nice smooth surface so no tension when gliding across it ."}
{"input": "multi - touch input works great ."}
{"input": "* build quality * - i ' m really pleased with the overall quality ."}
{"input": "it ' s light enough to carry pretty much every where ."}
{"input": "it starts up , runs without issues ."}
{"input": "even the speakers are way better than i expected from a 2 in 1 at this price point ."}
{"input": "this is finally the chromebook i ' ve been waiting for , that is not a $ 1300 pixel ."}
{"input": "- the screen has great contrast and is glossy and sharp"}
{"input": "- this may be a personal preference but i did wish the screen was a tad bit brighter ."}
{"input": "overall great chromebook ."}
{"input": "this is a spectacular chromebook ."}
{"input": "it ' s faster , the screen is much nicer , and it has twice the memory and four times the drive space ."}
{"input": "the core m3 processor allows the c302 to be fanless , as well , adding to the sleek design ."}
{"input": "it ' s a real timesaver , honestly ."}
{"input": "i find the display sharp and touch responsive to be quite excellent ."}
{"input": "at the end of the day i think it is worth the extra cost if you are looking for a premium product feel ."}
{"input": "- nice , bright screen ( touchscreen , too ! )"}
{"input": "battery doesn ' t last nearly as long as advertised ."}
{"input": "this is a very cleverly designed and fast machine ."}
{"input": "operational speed - - likely the fastest laptop i have ever used ( for basic functions ) ."}
{"input": "edit 2 : 8 months in and everything is working great ."}
{"input": "- trackpad isn ' t the best ."}
{"input": "- the touch screen isn ' t as accurate as i wish , for cases like tapping tiny things around the edges ."}
{"input": "- the screen size is an awkward 16 : 9 and provides a 1920x1080 resolution ( although the default is set to 1536x864 ) ."}
{"input": "for 99 % of the people looking at chromebooks right now for personal use , this asus is probably the best choice in the market ."}
{"input": "overall , i am extremely impressed with this chromebook and would highly recommend this to others ."}
{"input": "it works well as a tablet ."}
{"input": "it works great as a laptop and for the things i do which tend to be web based ."}
{"input": "nevertheless , i did have my own nitpicking issues with it but for the $ 250 price tag it launched with , it was well worth it ."}
{"input": "i found the display to be very vibrant , with excellent pixel density ."}
