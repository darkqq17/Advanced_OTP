Output: [('chrome os devices', 'MEMORY OPERATION_PERFORMANCE', 'NULL', 'Neural')]

Input: the extra ram , however , is great for everyone , as it makes this device more capable of running many tabs , or handling higher demand tasks like streaming content , without tabs crashing out or caching / reloading .
